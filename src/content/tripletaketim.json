Having spent a lot of time in workplaces, I've encountered these archetypes: the passive-aggressive talker, the mansplainer, the nervous wreck. This gave me a chance to explore all three in one ridiculous situation.",
      "technicalExploration": "Rather than play with framing, I focused on the intentions. I used costuming to differentiate the office archetypes. I played with different rhythms, pacing, and levels of self-awareness to see how everyday awkwardness tips from relatable to ridiculous. In one take, I imagined an official complaint had been made and Greg was forced to apologise — which completely shifted the power dynamic."

Alex is literally talking about a book called The History of Bricks — it's super dorky, and as a dork myself, that landed. This piece let me explore a bit of vulnerability within a comedic context: a relatable dad-type trying a little too hard to impress. It fit perfectly into my \"dad/everyman with range\" brand, giving me the opportunity to play with levels of warmth and sometimes disconnect, awkward humour, and subtle insecurity.",
      "technicalExploration": "Three distinct takes experimenting with how physical choices and framing shift character:\n\nTake 1: US Accent – Glasses and simple framing. Just a guy who genuinely loves bricks. Costuming allows for a bit more of a hipster feel. \n\nTake 2: US Accent – Added accessories (bracelets, earring) to see how props inform different character choices. Experimented with a different relationship to the offscreen character.\n\nTake 3: Australian Accent – Vertical phone format, shot as if it were an actual FaceTime call. This broke traditional self-tape convention and ended up feeling more personal, friendly, and fun."

It's a great scene to play around with — I could do a lot with the relationship. Being quite a niche scene, it's also original enough that I can explore it without any preconceptions.",
      "technicalExploration": "Explored different levels of meltdown and self-awareness. Played with questions like: Was I embarrassed about the breakdown? Was I proud? How much did I care about how I looked? What was my relationship to Michael — did I want him there, want to impress him, or want him to leave?\n\nI used costuming and hair to show where I felt I was mentally in the scene. A dressing gown showed I really wasn't thinking about how I looked, while other costume choices reflected different levels of self-consciousness."

The scene between Carmy and Richie was performed with such depth — I knew I wanted to explore that, but in my own way. My rendition is completely different from the show, which is exactly what I was going for. I was using the script, not the setting.",
      "technicalExploration": "Rather than focus too much on delivery variations, I decided to let framing, costume, and setting inform the scene. A fly interrupted one take, so I rolled with it and even grabbed some fly spray. I used a non-traditional shot lying down, played with a couch setup and decorative coffee table, and tried a standard white background with fake tattoo and similar accessories. These all created different tones without me having to shift the performance much at all."
