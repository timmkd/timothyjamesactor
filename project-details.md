I want to build a website that I can easily update, potentially using a CMS, but it doesn't have to be. Here are the priorites, please help me make a plan and solution.

- Build a website for an actor
- Should be able to list CV, headshots, videos/reels, links, social media, about info, images.
- Should be able to sort credits in a simple grid where I can change the grouping and sorting (date, category etc)
- Details for the content are on my cv in cv/Timothy-James-profile.pdf
- Should be able to deploy on a free server like netlify (but any free server is fine)
- The free server should be one that is widely used and also easy to use
- The website design should be simple, clean and modern

I am a react frontend developer so I am happy to use front end technologies. I am also happy to use something that will give me more experience using modern tech stacks.
